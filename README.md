# CryptoDashboard

To run the program use the command 'streamlit run "In here copy the file path of the main file"'

This program is a web-based dashboard application that displays the data of a given cryptocurrency. It gives information on the open, close, high, low and volume of a specific cryptocurrency within a given date range. This allows a user to get a simple historic overview on the price performance of a crypto-asset.


To Do:

1. Annotate code so I know what everything does when I look back on it in the future.


Some future implementations that I can add to this project are:

1. Using an API instead of manually downloading and uploading a csv file to read off. This can be done by connecting to one of the many crypto-exchange brokers who offer a free API service and fetching liove data from them.

2.
